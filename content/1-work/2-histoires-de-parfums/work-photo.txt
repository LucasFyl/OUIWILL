Text: 

Histoires de Parfums is a Paris based perfume collection that perpetuates the French perfumery know-how and sense of luxury, nobility and creativity. 
The idea behind each fragrance is to evoke a story through scent just as an emotion can be evoked through writing. Each scent in the library embodies a character, chosen by the founder for their unique and fascinating personalities. 
This Is Not A Blue Bottle is a new fragrance by Histories de Parfums that is inspired by the self-contradictory idea of an un-written story.  This fragrance was created for the person who is bold enough to invent themself and to write their own story. Oui Will partnered with the founder and creative director of HDP to create a video for the product release of This Is Not A Blue Bottle to be presented to Sephora USA.
