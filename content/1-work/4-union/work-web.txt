Union is a San Diego co-work space that was conceived to give small businesses and entrepreneurs the environment, community, and support services they need to grow and thrive. 
With the co-working office space market becoming increasingly saturated, it was imperative that Oui Will differentiated Union within their niche. To do this we focused not only on the space itself, but also on the people in oer to story-line the collaboration process among members. 
Oui Will developed the brand strategy and identity system for Union, rolling out the signage of each location, collateral, and the website, which integrates custom digital membership cards for community perks and rewards.
