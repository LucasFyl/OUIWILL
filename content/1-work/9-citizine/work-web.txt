Citizine TV is a Los Angeles based online network thatâ€™s changing the way people discover travel and culture by shining light on the most interesting stories and perspectives around the world. This type of cross-channel content creation and distribution network is next-generation, appealing to a millennial audience in the way they seek out and gather information online. 
Citizine partnered up with Oui Will to create their new web platform that features a custom interactive map for finding video by destination, and a custom CMS and tagging system, so their team can quickly and easily add, update, and distribute their video content.
