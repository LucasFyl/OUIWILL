Under the high patronage of Prince Albert II of Monaco, Only Watch is the third biggest luxury watch event and charity auction in the world in which the finest watch makers create one unique model to raise money for research on Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. 
The renowned collection travels the world, starting in Monaco, and ending in Geneva the epicenter of high horology where hundreds of connoisseurs, donators and collectors undoubtedly raise their highest interest for bidding on the exquisite timepieces. 
Only Watch partnered with Oui Will to create a new brand identity system, supported by a new website, video content, and photography.
