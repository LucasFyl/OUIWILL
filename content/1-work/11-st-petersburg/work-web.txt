St. Petersburg is a top-shelf Russian vodka brand whose artisanal recipe is the pride of its historic, namesake city. 
First crafted over 300 years ago, St. Petersburg is still known today as the drink of friendship and remains the first choice of many Russians for celebrating occasions big and small. 
Outscoring Belvedere and Grey Goose premium vodkas in taste has elevated St. Petersburg to new heights.
