Title: Beaming

Text: 

This progressive superfood brand is already making waves in wellness. Inspired by the concept of “letting food be thy medicine,” Beaming was conceived with the mission of changing the way people eat, drink, and think. 
From their cold pressed juices and smoothies to their famous cleanse programs, Beaming offers a plant-based culinary experience that has quickly gained popularity among wellness gurus and socialites alike. 
Oui Will partnered with Beaming to create new identity guidelines and packaging strategy that appeals to a more affluent and conscious customer-base. Beaming is a growing company, so defining strong brand guidlines was vital for consistency across future applications.
