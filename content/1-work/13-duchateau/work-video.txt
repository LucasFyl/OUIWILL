Title: Duchateau Serie

Text: 

DuChateau is a luxury brand specializing in architectural finishes ranging from hardwood and vinyl flooring to wall coverings, doors and beyond. 
Their creative vision and constant dedication to innovation has given them the ability to maintain a style that it both timeless and contemporary and has allowed them to grow into other product categories.  
While their style and vision clearly translates through their product offering, this message isn’t reaching an audience online, which accounts for a large group of prospective consumers. Oui Will partnered up with DuChateau’s marketing team to create a series of videos and content that personifies the luxury lifestyle of the brand, bringing it to life by strategically engaging a community on social platforms.
