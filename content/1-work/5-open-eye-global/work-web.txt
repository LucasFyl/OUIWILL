Open Eye Global helps their clients sync with their customers by creating technology-driven digital experiences for first and lasting impressions. After a week-long workshop gathering valuable input from their team, we set out to create a refreshed identity and messaging platform that restored their vision of who they really are and what they are capable of achieving. 
These elements became a valuable internal tool, but also helped them to communicate their story and connect with their audience online. 
In addition to revamping the site with the new brand elements, we created an entirely new user experience with interactive modules to reflect the level of creativity and thought-leadership they provide for their clients.
